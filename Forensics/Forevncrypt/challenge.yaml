  After reading this article, I'm now hesitant to use xz-utils for compression:

  As a result, I've been searching for alternative compression tools. I found one online, but unfortunately this tools are trash  because it has limited features. Specifically, Iâ€™m unable to decompress files that were compressed with a password. Could you please help me recover them?
