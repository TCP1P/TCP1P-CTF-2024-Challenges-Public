  A few days ago, I saw a funny post on a social media platform.

  As far as I remember, there are five accounts that frequently post funny and random content.

  I only remember two names: Udin Kurniawan Jaeger and Paijo Abdul Uchiha.

  I recall that one of them uses a fake account. The humor in his posts is quite random, and I like it.

  I want to know the real name of the person using that second account because I want to connect with him on his main account.

  Please help me find his full real name.


  The flag is the full name

  Example: TCP1P{Kresna Yang Asli}

  *Pro tips: Check the case sensitive!

flags:
- TCP1P{Slamet Setiawan Uzumaki}
